## Federal Government

### Legislative Branch

Representing Congress, the Legislative Branch has the authority to create and vote upon certain laws. Under Article I Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress has the following powers specifically enumerated to them:

- declare war
- establish the post office
- maintain the armed forces
- coin money

Additionally, Congress may regulate commerce under the Interstate Commerce Clause and make any other laws necessary for carrying out its consitutional duties

**preemption**: higher-ranking law will exclude a lower-ranking law on the same subject. Especially true when considering state and federal laws under the Interstate Commerce Clause, wherein states are preempted from making laws that may affect trade relations between the states

Besides the Interstate Commerce Clause, Congress may also enact the Necessary and Proper Clause to legislate in a number of further ways

The steps that a bill, an initial draft of a potential law, must follow in order to be enacted into law are as follow:

1. the bill is introduced in a chamber and moved into a specialty committee
2. in the committee, the bill is revised, and hearings are held to determine if a law is needed in the first place
3. the committee votes on if the bill should be sent to the whole chamber for consideration
4. if the bill passes the whole chamber it is moved to the next chamber for consideration
5. if the bill passes the next chamber, it is moved to a conference committee of both Representatives and Senators wherein compromise on both bill versions is attempted. This is called **conference**
6. both chambers vote on the same compromised version of the bill
7. if the bill passes, it is sent to the president to sign. If it is not signed within ten days, it automatically passes

Federal laws are published in the United States Code, with this being updated every ten years

### Executive Branch

The Executive Branch is in charge of enforcing the laws and maintaining the day-to-day operations of the federal government. The president may sign or veto Congressional bill, with vetoed bills being overcome by a two-third majority vote in both chambers. A signed bill becomes an Act of Congress which is federal law

The president may also appoint federal judicial, executive, and administrative officials. The Senate must approve some of these positions such as Cabinet members or federal judicial appointees. Additionally, the president may negotiate treaties with other countries, with the Senate having to ratify these treaties

### Judicial Branch

The Supreme Court is the only court specifically required by the Constitution. All federal court judges are appointed for life to ensure a neutral interpretation of the law

Courts have the ability to only hear cases that are within their jurisdiction. The main types of jurisdiction are:

- **original jurisdiction**: the power of a court to hear the initial dispute between parties. These courts conduct trials, and trial courts typically have original jurisdiction
- **concurrent jurisdiction**: jurisdiction that is shared by several different courts
- **appellate jurisdiction**: the power of a court to review a decision made by a lower court
- **diversity of citizenship jurisdiction**: the power of federal courts to hear only disputes between citizens of different states that are above a certain dollar amount
- **federal question jurisdiction**: power of federal courts to hear only disputes about federal laws or consitutional issues

Congress has the power under Article III to make as many lower-level federal courts as needed

District courts are the lowest level federal courts, with each state having at least one federal judicial district. District courts have original jurisdiction and may conduct civil and criminal law

Appellate courts are the next level of courts. There are thirteen appeals courts, twelve hearing cases from each of twelve circuits (groups of district courts) with the thirteenth hearing cases from the specialized Federal Circuit. These courts have **appellate jurisdiction**, meaning that they don't review the facts or evidence of a case and instead review the record of the trial court for mistakes of law

The Supreme Court is the highest court and also has appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court is not obligated to review an appeals court decision, with parties requesting the court's review by a *writ of certiorari* petition. The court may review a case if at least four of its nine justices support the writ. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction for disputes between state governments and concurrent jurisdiction with federal district courts on some cases. Most cases heard by the Supreme Court are appeals. The Supreme Court holds sole authority of **judicial review**, which grants it the power to review both state and federal laws to determine if they are constitutional

## State Governments

Powers that are not specifically granted to the federal government in the Constitution remain with the states under the Tenth Amendment

Most states are organized under their own constitution which typically describes the relation between the states and their citizens (unlike the U.S. Constitution which describes the relations between the states and the federal government)

The Supremacy Clauses state that the federal Constitution, treaties, and federal laws outrank any conflicting state laws

Most states have a court system similar to the federal court system. Trial courts are the lowest-level ones and hold original jurisdiction, with appellate courts coming next and finally the state supreme court

## Sources of American Law

### Common Law

Common law is law that has been developed through legal tradition and court cases. The common law in this country has been inherited from England and it changes very slowly as judges decide decisions, a process known as *judge-made law*. Decisions are based on related court cases, legal principles, and the customs and values of society and may evolve over time

### Code Law

Code law is law that has been enacted by legislatures and may also be known as *statutory* law. In many states both common and code law work together to form the greater law of society, but in cases where the two conflict code law supersedes common law

### Constitutional Law

The U.S. Constitution is the final source of authority for issues involving federal law. Federal laws are examined to see if they are constitutional or not, which in turn determines their validity. State constitutions may also be the final source of authority for issues within a particular state, but if that constitution is in violation of federal law or the federal Constitution then it is made invalid

## Types of Law

There are two primary types of law:

- **procedural law**: law that ensures due process, meaning that all parties are entitled to fair and consistent treatment. Sub-types are criminal, civil, and administrative law
- **substantive law**: law that allows specialization of an attorney, such as contracts, torts, elder law, and intellectual property

### Civil Law

Civil law concerns claims between individuals and starts when a *complaint* is filed by one party against another. The majority of civil trial cases must be proven by a **preponderance of the evidence**, which represents the lowest level of proof required. In some types of cases this may be "clear and convincing evidence"

### Criminal Law

Criminal law deals with criminal codes, which are actions specified by both federal and state governments that specify a crime. The rules outlining the criminal trial process are located in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. For criminal cases, the standard of proof required is "beyond a reasonable doubt"

### Administrative Law

Administrative law is the process under which administrative agencies make and enforce rules. Agencies are typically stood up to regulate a specific sector of law or policy. Administrative law ensures that all citizens who go before these agencies are treated fairly, as the agencies themselves are an extension of government. The burden of proof for these cases is "not arbitrary and capricious"

## The Role of Precedent

Precedent means that courts will look at the decisions made in prior cases to determine the appropriate resolution for new cases. This especially true in terms of the Supreme Court. As the highest court in the land, lower courts are required to rule in favor of Supreme Court decisions for related cases that they hear. This doctrine is known as *stare decisis*, meaning that lower courts must follow the precedent set by higher ones

Precedent is not always set-in-stone, and may change to reflect the changing of values over time. For example, see Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

## Regulatory Authorities

The federal government delegates some regulatory and enforcement functions to administrative agencies as otherwise it would be impossible for Congress to handle it all by itself. An agency is defined as any government authority besides Congress and the courts, and all agencies fall under the Executive Branch. Agencies create rules, enforce compliance, and administer sanctions in their specified area. Additionally, Congress may also create independent agencies that report directly to it, such as the FTC

## Compliance v. Audit

**compliance**: action of following applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Processes that might be used to demonstrate compliance include:

- creating policies to comply with legal or regulatory requirements
- comparing compliance requirements against an organization's daily practices and modifying those practices
- creating training and awareness activities to educate employees about compliance requirements

**audit**: an evaluation and verification that certain objectives are met, usually conducted to ensure an organization is complying with laws and regulations. Audits are internal inspections at a fix point in time

Compliance is demonstrated by the processes and procedures that an organization uses to meet the law. Audit verifies those processes and procedures actually do satisfy the legal requirements

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

**security**: the practice of protecting information to ensure the goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Makes sure that accurate information is available to authorized individuals when it is needed

**privacy**: people's right to have control of their personal data. People have the right to specify how that data is collected, used, and shared

**compliance**: the action of following applicable laws and rules and regulations regarding information. Compliance is supported by documenting organization controls and enhancing the capabilities of information systems to ensure information security
